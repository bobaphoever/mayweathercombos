# mayweathercombos
A web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls out random boxing combinations at quick intervals to simulate a coach or pad holder for the user to shadowbox. This was inspired by Floyd Mayweather JR and his uncle Roger Mayweather when they do mittwork. The combos aren't your traditional combos, they're actually names for specific sequences that are meant to be chained together. 

For example: ROLL means to roll under the opponent's left hook (assuming both of you are in an orthodox stance) and to fire a rear cross, lead hook, rear cross (2-3-2 for those who are used to numbered boxing system). 90% of the combos/sequences involve the 2-3-2 (cross, lead-hook, cross). The interface will further explain the combos and sequences. 

This is just a very simple web app for personal use; I plan on developing this into a mobile app.
